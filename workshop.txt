description=*** If you have stuttering issues you can now download the mod options (https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2169435993/4260919351480715709/) mod and turn on 'lite mode' which will hopefully fix the issue. ***

description=Immersive Solar Arrays (ISA) adds a solar power system to Project Zomboid. It allows players to power their bases during the day, and during the night if they have enough battery capacity.
description=
description=ISA adds several new items to Zomboid, including solar panels, battery banks, deep-cycle batteries, and recipes to convert car batteries into storage batteries.
description=
description=You can right-click on a battery bank and select battery bank status, this will display information about the battery bank, like how many panels you have connected and if they can power the current devices connected.
description=
description=Battery bank problems can often be resolved by resetting them from the right click context menu.
description=
description=All solar panels produce the same power which depend on what is set in the sandbox settings.
description=
description=Check out the wiki for more information about sandbox options:
description=https://github.com/radx5Blue/ImmersiveSolarArrays/wiki/Sandbox-Options
description=
description=If you use solar panels and the generator at the same time, the gas in the generator will be wasted. However, if you make a ‘Solar Fail Safe’ and place it on the same square as a generator, the generator will start up automatically when the solar panels don’t produce enough power and you run out of battery power.
description=
description=Solar Panels produce less energy when it is cloudy/foggy/raining.
description=
description=Also, during the year dawn and dusk start at different times, mornings start later in winter and earlier in summer.
description=
description=The battery bank just needs to be placed nearby the solar panels, they can be one level above or one level below.
description=
description=You don’t need to start a new game to find the items, but you will need to search a new area to find the mod items.
description=
description=To get started you will need to train your Electrical to skill level 3 and find the magazine "New Advancements: Energy From The Sun"
description=Reading this magazine will teach you all the relevant recipes to set up your own solar arrays.
description=
description=To set up your first solar array you will need to find:
description=A few Solar Panels
description=An Inverter
description=To create a simple set up these additional items will be needed.
description=
description=A Screwdriver to put it all together
description=Electric Wire x 6
description=Small Sheet Metal x 5
description=Electronics Scrap x 6
description=Metal Bar x 4
description=
description=All of this will allow you to craft a Battery Bank and a Solar Roof Tile. Once these items are crafted you can place down the Solar Roof Tile and Battery Bank and provided there isn't too many appliances nearby you should have power during the day!
description=
description=Battery banks work like containers and you place the batteries inside them. Note that if you want to use car batteries you need to wire them first.
description=
description=Solar panels and parts can be found in warehouses, electronics stores and other places that would fit that kind of equipment. Inverters and deep cycle batteries can also be found in warehouses, as well as garages and auto shops.
description=
description=All the loot is quite rare. In addition to random loot, there are special boxes of solar stuff that spawn at select predetermined locations, like stores and warehouses. Select remote buildings have a chance to spawn with a solar panel already installed.
description=
description=You can use this link to estimate how many solar panels you will need for your set up:

description=
description=(Cheats like teleporting away from the solar array can cause issues with food not freezing correctly, to avoid this move over 50 squares away before teleporting and teleport back at least 50 squares away.)
